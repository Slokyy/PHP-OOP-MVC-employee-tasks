# Object Oriented PHP using the MVC design pattern âœ¨ðŸ¥³âš¡

This is one of the projects I am most proud of as it challenged me the most during my training bootcamp.
OOP and MVC always seemed so unreachable to me but in the end I believe I did a great job here.
Mind you the project is not perfect and there for sure are things that I can improve.

## Setup ðŸ“ƒ

Basically you need PHP (above 8.0 at least, might even 8.1), Apache, MySQL.
In the root of the app there is a sql file called backend_zaposleni.sql that holds the database structure and some dummy data.
You need to put in your database info in ./classes/Database/Database.php
The only thing important here in the app is that the admin is the user, rest are employees and they are
just put in the same table but hold no passwords. Admin is: johndoe@macrohard.com and the password is: secret, yea literally its the word secret.

## Final ðŸ¥³

Please enjoy in exploring and feel free to contact me with suggestions. I believe I really grew while working on this project and even tho the condition of the task didn't require me to make the mvc system with autoloader I feel no regret in pouring in the time because in the end I gained so much experience through it.
